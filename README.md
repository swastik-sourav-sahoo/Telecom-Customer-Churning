# Telecom Customer Churning
## Introduction
This is a basic project on Machine Learning which allows us to predict the customer churning of a telecom companies. Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. Telecom companies predict whether a customer will stop using their services or not. 

## Problem statement
Build a ML model to predict the customer churn for a telecom company.

## Rationale
If it is predicted that a customer will stop using the services, the companies can take actions by giving him/her several offers, vouchers and discounts.

## How To Run
1. Download the project. The project is inside the Telecom Customer Churning directory.
2. Open the Churn.ipynb file jupyter notebook.
3. Run all the cells.
4. Enter the customer ID you want to find. You will get the result.

## Implementation
In this project, **Machine Learning** using **Python** have been used and developed with **Jupyter Notebook**.<br>
1. The dataset is given in churn.csv file which was downloaded from Kaggle.
2. After the prediction is done, a new column "action" is added which stores the appropriate comments.
3. Customer ID can be entered to fetch the required action of a particular customer.

## Note
This project is meant for learning purposes only. Feel free to use the code if needed. <br>
The project is not deployed on any application. It is just the development of the ML part.
